# Calendly Setup Guide

## Scheduling Page Messaging

Replace the default message with this:

### Option 1: Professional & Concise (Recommended)

```
Thanks for your interest in Host Overflow!

Select a time below to discuss how we can help you capture more revenue from overflow calls during peak hours. We'll walk through your specific needs and show you how the system works.

Looking forward to speaking with you!
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Acknowledges their interest (positive tone)
- ✅ Sets clear expectations (what they'll get)
- ✅ Benefits-focused (revenue capture)
- ✅ Professional but warm
- ✅ Short enough to read quickly

---

### Option 2: More Detailed (If You Want to Qualify Leads)

```
Thanks for your interest in Host Overflow!

During our 30-minute demo, we'll:
• Discuss your current challenges with missed calls
• Show you how the AI handles different types of guest questions
• Walk through the setup process (takes just 15 minutes)
• Answer questions about safety, transfers, and customization

We're currently enrolling pilot restaurants for the holiday season. Select a time that works for you below.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Sets clear agenda (professional)
- ✅ Qualifies leads (mentions pilot program)
- ✅ Shows value (what they'll learn)
- ✅ Creates urgency (holiday season)

---

### Option 3: Short & Direct (Minimalist)

```
Let's discuss how Host Overflow can help you capture missed calls during rush hours.

Select a time below that works for you.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Ultra concise
- ✅ Action-oriented
- ✅ No fluff
- ✅ Works great if they've already read the landing page

---

## My Recommendation

**Use Option 1** - It strikes the perfect balance between professional and approachable. Restaurant operators are busy people; they appreciate clarity without unnecessary length.
